# Titanic Dataset Visualization Project 🚢📊

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization of the Titanic dataset. We use Python libraries like **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** to gain insights from the data and represent them visually.

## 📌 Objective
To understand the patterns in the Titanic disaster dataset — who survived and who didn't, and how factors like **age, sex, passenger class, and fare** affected survival.

## 📁 Dataset Source
- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- Survival Count
- Survival by Gender
- Survival by Passenger Class
- Age Distribution
- Correlation Heatmap
- Fare Distribution
- Survival vs Fare and Age (Scatterplot)
- Boxplots and Violin plots

## 📈 Key Insights
- Women had a much higher survival rate than men.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Most passengers were in the age range of 20–40.
- Higher fare paid increased chances of survival.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repo or download the ZIP.
2. Replace `titanic.csv` with the real dataset from Kaggle.
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter.
