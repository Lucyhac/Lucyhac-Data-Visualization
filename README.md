# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Seaborn**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 📌 Objective
To discover key factors that affected survival rates during the Titanic disaster using visual exploration.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📊 Visualizations Included
- Survival Count
- Survival by Gender
- Survival by Passenger Class
- Age Distribution
- Fare Distribution
- Correlation Heatmap
- Survival vs Fare and Age (Scatterplot)
- Boxplot of Age by Class and Survival
- Violin Plot of Fare by Class and Survival

## 📈 Key Insights
- Women had a significantly higher survival rate than men.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Higher fare generally meant better survival chances.
- Age and family had minor influence; class and fare were dominant factors.
